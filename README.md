abstract
--------
In which we ask whether you can do spectroscopy with imaging;
  especially if you observe similar objects at different redshifts.
Can you infer the redshifts and the spectra simultaneously?
Can you infer the *bandpasses*, redshifts, and spectra simultaneously?
What limits are there on the resolution of the spectra and redshifts you can infer?
What does this all have to do with *LSST* and other future imaging surveys?
